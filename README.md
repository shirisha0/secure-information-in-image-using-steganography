Secure Information Transmission in Image Using Steganography

1.Image steganography involves hiding information within image files. There are various techniques used to achieve this, but one common method is known as the Least Significant Bit (LSB) insertion. Here's an overview of how LSB steganography works:

2.Select an image: Choose an image that will serve as the carrier for the hidden information. It can be in common formats like JPEG, PNG, or BMP.

3.Convert the hidden information: If the data you want to hide is in text or any other format, you'll need to convert it into binary form. Each character or data element will be represented by a sequence of bits.

4.Identify the LSB: The LSB refers to the least significant bit of each pixel in the image. In most images, the LSB doesn't significantly affect the overall appearance, so it can be modified without noticeable visual changes.

5.Embed the hidden information: Starting from the first pixel or a specific pattern, replace the LSB of each pixel with bits from the hidden information. For example, if the hidden data bit is '0,' leave the pixel's LSB unchanged; if it's '1,' modify the pixel's LSB to match the hidden bit.

6.Repeat the process: Continue embedding the hidden information in subsequent pixels until all the data has been concealed.

7.Save the modified image: Once the information is hidden within the image, save the modified image file. Make sure to remember the method and parameters used during embedding for later extraction.

8.Extract the hidden information: To retrieve the hidden information, repeat the process of examining the LSB of each pixel in the modified image. Collect the LSBs to reconstruct the binary data. Convert the binary data back to its original format if necessary.
